# Product Overview

OuroborOS-Chimera is a fully local, static web application that simulates a self-modifying "living organism" using multiple programming languages compiled to WebAssembly, with blockchain governance, quantum entropy, and biological sensors.

## Purpose

Create an experimental platform for exploring emergent behavior through self-modifying code, combining multiple programming paradigms (Lisp, ALGOL, Fortran, Rust, Solidity) in a browser-based simulation with blockchain governance. The system demonstrates polyglot WebAssembly interoperability while providing a retro computing aesthetic and integrating external services for quantum randomness and physical sensor feedback.

## Key Features

- **Self-Modifying Lisp Interpreter**: Organism can rewrite its own behavior rules at runtime
- **ALGOL DSL**: Readable domain-specific language that compiles to Lisp for rule definition
- **Multi-Language WASM**: Rust orchestrator + Fortran numeric engine + Go neural clusters working together
- **Blockchain Governance**: Solidity smart contracts for decentralized mutation proposals and voting
- **Quantum Entropy**: Qiskit-based quantum random number generation for true randomness
- **Bio Sensor Network**: Raspberry Pi sensors (light, temperature, motion) for environmental input
- **Retro Terminal UI**: Pascal/Turbo Pascal-style green-on-black text interface
- **Multi-Source Entropy**: WebCrypto, WebGPU noise, quantum circuits, device sensors for unpredictable evolution
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Graph and fractal views of organism state with blockchain timeline
- **Local Persistence**: Save/load snapshots with blockchain proof verification
- **Fully Static**: Core runs without server, optional services for extended features
- **Browser-Based**: Runs client-side with graceful degradation when services unavailable
